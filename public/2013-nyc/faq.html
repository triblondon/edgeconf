					<h3 id='q1'>Who should attend?</h3>
					<p>If you are a web developer using technologies that you can only find in pre-release versions of browsers, and you are finding that they don’t quite work as you think they should, we want to see you at Edge. Or if you have developed intricate workarounds, shims or polyfills to make up for the deficiencies of web standards or differences in implementation between browsers, you should come too.</p>

					<h3 id='q2'>What does it cost?</h3>
					<p>Tickets are $100, which is used to pay for panelist travel expenses and a few minor things like lanyards and badges. All remaining funds will be donated to <a href='http://www.girlswhocode.com'>Girls who Code</a>.</p>

					<h3 id='q4'>Why aren't there more women on the panels?</h3>
					<p>We're very much aware that our panels are male dominated, which <a href='http://archive.aneventapart.com/alasurvey2011/01.html'>reflects the broader developer community</a>. Underrepresentation of women in the industry is a problem we fully acknowledge and is something everyone in the community should be working hard to change, the organisers of this event included. There are many ways of doing this, and it can't be as simple as saying that every event without exception must be representative (or even over-representative) to have any legitimacy. If small, niche events go unstaged for fear of unintentionally provoking arguments over diversity, then we're the poorer for the lack of valuable knowledge sharing opportunities that those events would have provided. More effective gains may be made through social initiatives such as <a href='http://www.girlswhocode.com'>Girls who code</a> which avoids the need for quotas and other discriminatory ways of creating diversity, which we will not accept.</p>
					<p>Edge also doesn't have any speakers in the traditional sense. Our panelists are not there to teach or lecture you, they're there to help and to learn from the most important people at the event - our delegates (who are selected via an anonymous process).</p>

					<h3 id='q5'>How do you choose your panelists?</h3>
					<p>Some of the panelists are employees of the conference organisers. They are paid to attend Edge, represent their company, and participate in the discussion as part of their job. They were nominated by their respective employers. The remainder come from exploring the networks of the organisers (a small group of employees of the FT and Google).  We also reached out to spec authors, relevant industry leading organisations, and organisations that promote the interests of underrepresented groups,  looking for panelist suggestions.</p>
					<p>The makeup of each panel is designed to offer a balanced range of different perspectives and expertise.</p>

					<h3 id='q6'>How do you choose the delegates?</h3>
					<p>Each delegate is asked to provide a short summary of what they would bring to the event.  We look at the summary and the name of their organisation (to avoid having too many delegates from the same organisation), and rank prospective delegates on a 1 to 5 scale.  When we have more applications than we have capacity in the venue, we start sending invites out, starting with those with the highest score.  We keep sending invites until all seats are taken.</p>

					<h3 id='q7'>What is your code of conduct?</h3>
					<p>Our conference is a place for free discussion and open exchange of ideas.  We can only truly achieve that if everyone involved feels that they are warmly welcomed and valued participants and that they are in a safe environment.  Although we may disagree with each other’s opinions, we should be able to do so without upsetting or being upset by others.  Please bear this in mind, and be courteous to and respectful of other delegates, panellists, organisers and staff, even if you disagree with them.  If you feel uncomfortable with the behaviour of someone at the conference, please let an organiser know privately, and we promise to take your concerns seriously.  Participants exhibiting behaviour the organisers find unacceptable may be asked to leave.  Organisers are bound by the codes of conduct of their respective organisations, which are available to view online:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href='http://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html'>Google code of conduct</a></li>
						<li><a href='http://www.pearson.com/responsibility/values/code-of-conduct.html'>Pearson code of conduct</a> (Pearson is the utimate parent of FT Labs)</li>

					<h3 id='q8'><em>Apply</em> for tickets?  What's up with that?</h3>
					<p>The organisers of Edge have a lot of conferences under their belts, and didn't want to just start a new conference that was the same as all the others.  One of the experimental aspects of Edge is that we open for registration for a period of time before tickets go on sale, and then we send ticket invites to delegates based on how much we think they have to contribute to the conference.  As experienced developers we find that the gap between the entry level and the cutting edge gets wider every day, and conferences need to move with the times.  Edge has made a decisive move to the cutting edge end - that means we want delegates who have unsolved problems, new solutions or interesting use cases to discuss.</p>
					<p>Does this create a sense of self-importance and exclusivity?  Well, we don't think so - we don't expect to know most of the attendees, the open registration process is just that - open to everyone, and the selection process is anonymised.  We're certainly no more exclusive than the many many many conferences that cost upwards of $1000.  Edge is a hundred bucks.   Unlike other conferences, we're not interested in your money.  We want your brain, and we don't think it's unreasonable to try and get the best 200 people in the room.</p>
