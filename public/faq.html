					<h3>Who should attend?</h3>
					<p>If you are a web developer using technologies that you can only find in pre-release versions of browsers, and you are finding that they don’t quite work as you think they should, we want to see you at Edge. Or if you have developed intricate workarounds, shims or polyfills to make up for the deficiencies of web standards or differences in implementation between browsers, you should come too.</p>

					<h3>What does it cost?</h3>
					<p>Tickets are $100, which is used to pay for speaker travel expenses. Any leftover funds will be donated to a local charity.  We'll be announcing who we're supporting shortly.</p>

					<h3>Who’s paying for everything then?</h3>

					<h3>Why aren't there more women on the panels?</h3>
					<p>We're very much aware that our panels are male dominated, which <a href='http://archive.aneventapart.com/alasurvey2011/01.html'>reflects the broader developer community</a>. Underrepresentation of women in the industry is a problem we fully acknowledge and is something everyone in the community should be working hard to change, the organisers of this event included. There are many ways of doing this, and it can't be as simple as saying that every event without exception must be representative to have any legitimacy. If small, niche events go unstaged for fear of unintentionally provoking arguments over diversity, then we're the poorer for the lack of valuable knowledge sharing opportunities that those events would have provided. As many gains may be made through social initiatives which avoid the need for quotas and other discriminatory ways of creating diversity.</p>
					<p>Also, Edge doesn't have any speakers in the traditional sense. Our panelists are not there to teach or lecture you, they're there to help and to learn from the most important people at the event - our delegates. Representation of women in our delegate list is roughly in line with the industry average.</p>

					<h3>How did you choose your panellists?</h3>
					<p>Some of the panellists are employees of the conference organisers. They are paid to attend Edge, represent their company, and participate in the discussion as part of their job. They were nominated by their respective employers. The remainder come from exploring the networks of the organisers, a small group of employees of the FT and Google.  We reached out to spec authors, relevant industry leading organisations, and organisations that promote the interests of underrepresented groups,  looking for panelist suggestions.</p>
					<p>The makeup of each panel is designed to offer a balanced range of different perspectives and expertise.</p>
