	/**
	 * Magic method to wrap memcached functions
	 *
	 * Any unknown method of this class (including all valid memcached methods documented at http://php.net/memcached) when called will trigger the __call method if it exists.  $name is the name of the method actually being invoked, and $args is the array or arguments.  In this way, we can wrap all current (and future) memcached methods with one method in this wrapper class.  Therefore, this method allows MemcacheAccess to be used as a drop in replacement for memcached.  Where previously you had:
	 *
	 * $memcache = new Memcached;
	 * ... servers config ...
	 * $memcache->get('key');
	 *
	 * You can now do:
	 *
	 * $memcache = MemcacheAccess:getMemcache();
	 * $memcache->get('key');
	 *
	 * By detecting whether the specified method is generally a read or write operation, the number of reads and writes, and hits or misses is incremented as appropriate.  These do not detect whether memcache actually does a read or write, they are simply based on the name of the method called.  For the most commonly used methods: get() is a read, set() is a write.
	 *
	 * @param string $name The name of the method being called
	 * @param array  $args The arguments passed to the method in a numerically indexed array
	 * @return mixed The return value is passed through from the underlying memcached method
